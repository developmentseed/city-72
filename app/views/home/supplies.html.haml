      %p Whether you’re just starting out or a preparedness pro, gathering your emergency supplies is easy. A good rule of thumb is to have supplies for about 3 days, or 72 hours. You’ll be surprised at how much you already have.

    %h2 Sharing is caring.
    %p Emergencies are opportunities to come together and support those around you. What items would you’d like to share? Uncorking a bottle of wine, singing songs, or sharing  a meal are even more meaningful in the days after an emergency than before.
